# 🧠 Telepathy - Voice Emotion Recognition System

**Transform voices into emotional insights with AI**

## What is Telepathy?

Telepathy is an AI-powered emotion detection system that analyzes voice recordings to identify emotional states. Using deep learning LSTM networks, it can detect 5 core emotions: **neutral, happy, sad, angry, and fearful**.

## Current Status

⚠️ **Prototype Stage** - Model needs training and testing

## Quick Start

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy sounddevice librosa tensorflow scikit-learn joblib
```

### Train Model (requires datasets)
```bash
